# OData service consumption

<!-- Dummy Update to trigger Content Portal -->

In this chapter we will explain how you can build your own versions of the custom API's

- [zcl_ac_salesorder_api](adt://TDI/sap/bc/adt/oo/classes/zcl_ac_salesorder_api)
- [zcl_ac_product_api](adt://TDI/sap/bc/adt/oo/classes/zcl_ac_product_api)

that have been provided for your convenience to speed up the development of this side-by-side extension.  

For this you have to perform the following steps:  

1. Retrieve Information from the API Hub  
2. Generate a service consumption model  
3. Create your own sales orderAPI class
4. Create your own product api class

When you have followed these steps you can replace the calls to the shared custom API's in your coding by calls of your own implementations.
